# Crafting Interpreters

In this repo I implement the interpreter as described in the [crafting interpreters online book](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom. My goal is to learn and understand the topics of the book. To further aid understanding I have created unit tests with Junit 4 which are not part of the book.
